# Hydropedology Lab

This is a collection of jupyter lab notebooks for the hydropedology class at TU Bergakademie Freiberg, summer term 2022.

I will keep this updating throughout our course.

You might also run the examples online through [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cojacoo/hydropedology_lab/HEAD?filepath=First_steps.ipynb).
